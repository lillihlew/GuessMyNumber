Test Plan
This test plan will test valid and invalid input. This test plan will only
cover the input of integers, as this program is not designed to handle
input of any other type. The first four tests will correctly guess the
number, the fifth test will not guess the number correctly, but only test
valid input, the sixth test will use valid and invalid input, and not guess
the number correctly, and the seventh test will test edge cases and not
guess the number correctly.

Valid Input
- Correctly guess the number: start with 50, then proceed according to output
- Do not guess the number: pick a random number, then proceed against the
ouput
- Test the same number the whole time
- Guess corner cases (1 and 100)

Invalid Input
- Test 0
- Test integers above 100
- Test negative integers


Expected output:

At the beginning of the program:
   "The purpose of the following program is to generate a random number between 1-100 and the user has the maximum number of 10 tries to guess the secret randomly generated number. Please only input whole numbers between 1-100 as your input."

Before every input from user:
"Input your guess as an integer between the range of 1-100."

In response to valid input:
    If the randomly-generated number is guessed correctly:
       "You have correctly guessed the number in n tries.", where n=number
       of guesses. (fixed post-testing: said "numbers" before this.)
    If the number guessed is too low:
       "Your guess was below the number, please try again."
    If the number guessed is too high:
       "Your guess was above the  number, please try again."
    If the tenth guess is unsuccessful:
       Corresponding message if guess is too low or high.
       "You are out of guesses. The correct number was n.", where n is the
       randomly generated number.

For invalid input:
    If guess is above 100 or below 1:
       "Your guess is out of bounds, please try again."



The program behaved as expected, so, we have fulfilled the criteria for
this project.
